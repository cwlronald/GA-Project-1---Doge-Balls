# Doge Balls

## Introduction
Welcome to Doge Balls, the first coding project I have ever done on Javascript! This was something that I never thought I would be able to do before the course started, but alas, here we are. People who know me, know I'm an all or nothing type of person. Hence, when deciding what game to create for the project, I decided to go all in on the nothing side of the spectrum. That does not mean I will create a poorly coded game, but rather I will create a simple game that is highly polished. 

After doing some googling for old school arcade games, this game felt like the kind of game I would mindlessly play while waiting for something else. Hence, I decided to work on it and added a splash of my personality into it.

## Code breakdown
Around 250+ lines of code for this game, no classes were used. The breakdown for the code are as follows:
- Create intro page
- Create the game
    - ball movement (left and right)
    - create platform + gaps
    - moving the platform + gaps up
    - interaction between the ball and gap
    - ball movement (down)
    
## Biggest challenge
Getting the platform and gaps to move upwards at the same time and same rate. I tried to use a for loop method to move the multiple gaps on the same platform. Unfortunately it did not work. I then opted to hardcode each gap and its movements
    
## Future improvements
- Mobile version
- Powerups
- Monsters that spawn and move down on vertical axis
- Hidden cheatcodes
- More memes
